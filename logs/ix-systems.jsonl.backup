  "lesson": "IX Coach demonstrates sophisticated full-stack coordination where frontend and backend mirror each other's patterns: (1) Both repos have internal docs at localhost:4173 with auto-enrichment from commits, (2) GPT-5 reasoning flows through coordinated pipeline - API emits reasoning deltas via SSE, frontend consumes them for admin-only visibility while keeping customer UX clean, (3) Model archetypes defined in both frontend (dashboard selector) and backend (config manifest) must stay aligned to prevent UX/API mismatch, (4) Session diagnostics span both layers - API emits severity metadata, frontend filters/visualizes it without network calls, (5) Both use Gen3 design patterns - backend for API structure, frontend for UI components, (6) Testing infrastructure symmetric - advisory Jest for frontend, agent testing tools for backend, (7) KPI optimization coordinated - cache diagnostics in API enable cost optimization, SEO structured data in frontend drives acquisition, admin tools in both accelerate velocity, (8) Compliance readiness - SOC 2 docs in API support enterprise sales that SEO funnel generates. This tight coupling between repos indicates monorepo-style coordination despite separate repositories, suggesting shared product vision and integrated deployment strategy.",
