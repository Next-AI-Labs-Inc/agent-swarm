Read $AGENT_SWARM_PATH/AGENTS.md first to determine if you are a local or cloud agent, then follow the appropriate instructions to access institutional knowledge across all agents working in this codebase.

CRITICAL: When instructed to "save memories" or "log what you learned" - run $AGENT_SWARM_PATH/scripts/log_memory.sh with your findings. DO NOT create .md files or documentation - use the log_memory.sh script to write to shared institutional knowledge that all agents can query.
