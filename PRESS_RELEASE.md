# FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

## Agent Swarm: Open Source Solution Brings Institutional Memory to AI Development Teams

**New MCP Server Enables AI Agents Across Claude, Cursor, and Warp to Learn, Remember, and Prioritize Work Based on ROI**

**San Francisco, CA ‚Äì January 24, 2025** ‚Äì Today marks the launch of Agent Swarm, an open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that solves a critical problem facing development teams using AI agents: knowledge that dies when sessions end.

### The Problem

Modern development teams increasingly rely on AI agents like Claude Desktop, Cursor IDE, and Warp Terminal. Each interaction teaches these agents valuable lessons about codebases, error patterns, and workflows. But that knowledge disappears the moment the session closes‚Äîforcing teams to re-teach the same lessons repeatedly.

"Every day, developers teach Claude how to fix the same error. The next day, Cursor encounters it and has no idea," explains the founder. "We're losing millions of hours of institutional knowledge simply because AI agents don't remember across tools and sessions."

### The Solution

Agent Swarm provides AI agents with persistent, queryable memory that survives across:
- Different AI tools (Claude ‚Üí Cursor ‚Üí Warp)
- Different team members
- Weeks, months, or years

But Agent Swarm goes beyond simple memory storage. It includes two groundbreaking features:

**1. Leverage-Based Task Prioritization**

Using the formula `Leverage = (Impact √ó Confidence √ó Momentum) / (Effort √ó Friction) √ó Stage`, Agent Swarm automatically ranks development work by ROI. Teams can ask "What should I work on?" and receive mathematically prioritized tasks filtered by business KPIs (churn reduction, revenue, velocity) and type (features, bugs, maintenance, quick wins).

**2. Operational Health Monitoring**

Teams can ask "How are things going?" and receive a customized checklist of monitoring tasks: error tracking, customer feedback, server metrics, payment health. The system includes pre-written ChatGPT prompts and direct dashboard links, reducing a 30-minute manual process to 5 minutes.

### Technical Innovation

Agent Swarm leverages Anthropic's Model Context Protocol‚Äîa new standard for AI agent communication‚Äîmaking it the first production-ready MCP server to demonstrate enterprise-grade features:

- **Speed**: JSONL storage with keyword + metadata scoring (sub-second queries)
- **Structured**: Rich metadata including KPIs, effort estimates, lifecycle states, dependencies
- **Configurable**: Adjustable KPI weights per sprint/quarter priorities
- **Cross-Tool**: Works with any MCP-compatible client (Claude, Cursor, Warp, custom agents)
- **Scalable**: Tested with 10,000+ memory entries

Future releases will add vector embeddings for semantic search while maintaining the current fast keyword system.

### Natural Language Interface

Agent Swarm responds to intuitive queries:
- "What should I work on?" ‚Üí Top 3 tasks by leverage
- "What's highest leverage?" ‚Üí Top 5 high-confidence tasks
- "What reduces churn?" ‚Üí Tasks filtered by churn reduction KPI
- "How are things going?" ‚Üí Daily operational health checklist
- "Show me maintenance tasks" ‚Üí Technical debt prioritized by ROI

### Use Cases

**Sprint Planning**: Product teams use Agent Swarm to automatically prioritize backlogs. "What should we build this sprint?" returns tasks ranked by leverage, filtered by business goals.

**Incident Response**: During outages, engineers query past similar incidents. Agent Swarm suggests fixes instantly, then captures the new solution for next time.

**Developer Onboarding**: New team members' agents inherit collective knowledge. Questions like "How do we handle API retries?" receive instant, context-rich answers from past implementations.

**Technical Debt**: Engineering teams ask "What maintenance improves velocity?" to surface highest-ROI refactoring work, balancing features vs. debt scientifically.

### Positioning

Agent Swarm fills the gap between traditional knowledge bases (Notion, Confluence) which require manual updates, and RAG systems which lack structured metadata and actionable prioritization.

| Feature | Traditional Docs | RAG Systems | Agent Swarm |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| AI-Native | ‚ùå Manual | ‚úÖ Automated | ‚úÖ Automated |
| Prioritization | ‚ùå None | ‚ùå None | ‚úÖ Leverage Formula |
| Cross-Tool | ‚ùå Siloed | ‚ùå Siloed | ‚úÖ MCP Standard |
| Actionable | ‚ùå Generic | ‚ùå Retrieval Only | ‚úÖ Monitor + Prioritize |
| Learns | ‚ùå Docs Rot | ‚ùå Static | ‚úÖ Self-Improving |

"Traditional tools require humans to remember to update them," notes the founder. "Agent Swarm captures knowledge automatically as you work, across all your AI tools."

### Availability

Agent Swarm is available now under the MIT License:
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/Next-AI-Labs-Inc/agent-swarm
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive setup guides for Claude Desktop, Cursor, Warp, and custom agents
- **Algorithm Details**: Full leverage scoring explanation with worked examples

### Company Background

Next AI Labs builds tools that help AI agents become more capable collaborators. Agent Swarm represents the company's belief that institutional knowledge should persist and evolve, not disappear with each session.

The team has extensive experience building AI-powered development tools and recognized the memory problem firsthand while working with early Claude Desktop and Cursor adopters.

### Quote

"We believe the future of development is AI agents that actually remember what they learn," says [Founder Name], CEO of Next AI Labs. "Agent Swarm makes that future real today. When your agents can share knowledge across tools and time, the compound effect is extraordinary. Teams report 30-50% reduction in repeated troubleshooting and significantly better sprint planning."

### Roadmap

Upcoming features include:
- Vector embeddings for semantic search (Q2 2025)
- GitHub integration for auto-creating issues from high-leverage tasks
- Slack bot for daily priority digests
- Web UI for visual backlog management
- Team analytics showing leverage accuracy over time

### Technical Specifications

- **Language**: Node.js 18+
- **Storage**: JSONL (JSON Lines) - one memory per line
- **Protocol**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) by Anthropic
- **Retrieval**: Keyword matching + recency + success rate scoring
- **Scalability**: Tested with 10,000+ entries, sub-second queries
- **License**: MIT (fully open source)

Hey HN,

I built Agent Swarm to solve a problem our team kept hitting: AI agents that forget.

We use Claude Desktop, Cursor, and Warp. Every day we'd teach them the same patterns, errors, workflows. Then the session would end and it's gone. Next day, repeat.

Agent Swarm is an MCP server (Anthropic's new protocol) that gives agents persistent memory. But it goes further with two unique features:

1. Leverage-Based Prioritization: Ask "What should I work on?" and get tasks ranked by ROI using (Impact √ó Confidence) / (Effort √ó Friction). Filter by KPI (churn, revenue, velocity) and type (bugs, features, maintenance).

2. Operational Health: Ask "How are things going?" and get a daily checklist of monitoring tasks (errors, metrics, customer feedback) with direct links and ChatGPT prompts.

Technical details:
- JSONL storage (keyword + metadata scoring, sub-second)
- Works with any MCP client (Claude, Cursor, Warp, custom)
- Configurable KPI weights
- Lifecycle tracking (planned ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí production)
- Open source (MIT), 10-minute setup

GitHub: https://github.com/Next-AI-Labs-Inc/agent-swarm
Demo: [link when ready]

Would love feedback from the HN community. What other features would make this more useful?
